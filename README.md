# Business-Analytics

### Intro
>“We’re onboarding a new client next month as part of a very large deal. It’s critical that we support them with our excellent service levels. I need to know how many tickets per week on average we can expect from this client so we can ensure we have enough help desk resources in place.”

**2 key analytical concepts** to understand business situation and analyze data.
  - A. Problem Solving Framework: CRISP-DM(Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) 
  - B. Methodology Map

**[A. CRISP-DM]** was originally developed by data miners in order to generalize the common approaches to defining and analyzing a problem. CRISP-DM is the "Problem Solving Framework". Let's have a mental model! The framework is made up of 6 steps:
  - 1)Business Issue Understanding
  - 2)Data Understanding
  - 3)Data Preparation
  - 4)Performing Analysis + Modeling
  - 5)Validation
  - 6)Presentation + Visualization
  
>ex> How much electricity capacity does the company need to supply for any given hour tomorrow in a utility company? 
  
**1) Business Issue Understanding** 
  - What decisions needs to be made?
  - What information is needed to inform those decisions?
  - What type of analysis can provide the information needed to inform those decisions?
    - >Research: How do we supply the power we need? 
    - >Prediction: How much electricity will be demanded in each hour of the day tomorrow?   

**2) Data Understanding** 
  - What data is needed and available?
  - What are the important characteristics of the data?
    - >Data Collecting: What factors drives electricity demand tomorrow? 

**3) Data Preparation**
  - Gathering - Cleansing - Formatting - Blending - Sampling
   
*Formatting* refers to format the data by changing the way a date field appears, renaming a field, or even rotating the data, similar to using a pivot table. *Blending* refers to combine the data with other datasets to enrich it with additional variables, similar to using the vlookup function in Excel. *Sampling* refers to sample the dataset and work with a more manageable number of records.

**4) Performing Analysis + Modeling**
  - Various modeling techniques are selected and applied, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values. Typically, there are several techniques for the same data mining problem type. Some techniques have specific requirements on the form of data. Therefore, stepping back to the data preparation phase is often needed.
    - >After creating a model, we repeat the process to predict electricity usage for a given hour on the next day. This includes the number of electricity plants we need for any given temperature, as well as the thresholds when we need to activate additional plants or purchase it on the market. 
    
**5) Validation**
  - Before proceeding to final deployment of the model, it is important to more thoroughly evaluate the model, and review the steps executed to construct the model, to be certain it properly achieves the business objectives. 

**6) Presentation + Visualization**
  - Determine the best method of presenting insights based on the audience
  - Make sure the amount of information shared is not overwhelming
  - Use the results to tell a story to the audience

## Ok, which methodology will we use? 

**[B. Methodology Map]** is a guide to determine the appropriate analytical technique(s) to solve a particular business question or problem. The map outlines two main scenarios for a business problem:

  - **Non Predictive Analysis**
refers to the more standard approaches of blending together data and reporting on trends and statistics and helps answer business questions that involve understanding more about the dataset such as "On average, how many people order coffee and a donut per transaction in my store in any given week?"

  - **Predictive Analysis**
help businesses predict future behavior based on existing data such as "Given the average coffee order, how much coffee can I expect to sell next week if I were to add a new brand of coffee?"
