# Business-Analytics

### Intro
>“We’re onboarding a new client next month as part of a very large deal. It’s critical that we support them with our excellent service levels. I need to know how many tickets per week on average we can expect from this client so we can ensure we have enough help desk resources in place.”

**2 key analytical concepts** to understand business situation and analyze data.
  - Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
  - Methodology Map

**CRISP-DM** was originally developed by data miners in order to generalize the common approaches to defining and analyzing a problem. CRISP-DM is the "Problem Solving Framework". The framework is made up of 6 steps:
  - 1)Business Issue Understanding
  - 2)Data Understanding
  - 3)Data Preparation
  - 4)Analysis/Modeling
  - 5)Validation
  - 6)Presentation/Visualization

**The Methodology Map** is a guide to determine the appropriate analytical technique(s) to solve a particular business question or problem. The map outlines two main scenarios for a business problem:

  - 1)Data analysis
refers to the more standard approaches of blending together data and reporting on trends and statistics and helps answer business questions that involve understanding more about the dataset such as "On average, how many people order coffee and a donut per transaction in my store in any given week?"

  - 2)Predictive analysis
help businesses predict future behavior based on existing data such as "Given the average coffee order, how much coffee can I expect to sell next week if I were to add a new brand of coffee?"
